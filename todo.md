# TODO
+ Player counts (ex. "1-4 players") [string]
+ Price (ex. "$15.99", "FREE") [string (or number, but most likely string)]
+ Organize with folders
+ maybe map/mode selection thing for some games
+ add wildcard that draws a random weird thing (start a rock session, roll a die to determine who gets to pick the game, watch an show/anime/movie, etc)
+ add mario kart wii/ctgp
